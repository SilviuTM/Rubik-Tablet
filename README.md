# Rubik-Tablet
Quick Project made in less than 48 hours using only the MonoGame framework to warm up my C# skills.

Basically it's all a mess. But if you are interested in digging through this project, just know that: 
- Game1.cs is where all the magic happens. (core class, everything is called here)
- GameContent.cs is the class that loads all assets.
- Menu.cs is the class for the Main Menu.
- Puzzle.cs is the class for the minigame itself.
- CustomMCursor.cs is the class that changes how the mouse cursor looks.
- Madness.cs is forbidden. do not research.

The Content folder contains the assets that are to be loaded into the game. 

That's it. (I may attach a .exe file to properly run the game, once I figure that out.)
